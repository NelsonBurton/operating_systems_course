##Introduction to Operating Systems
###CS 8803, GT OMSCS

##My code is for problem sets:

1. reader-writer.c - playing around with the pthread's library, showing how multiple readers can read a resource, while a writer holds a mutex and blocks those readers.

2. client-simple-socket.c, server-simple-socket.c - basics of networking: including grabbing a socket, binding it to a port, listening on that port, accepting connections, sending/receiving data, and finally closing. client and server talk to each other on port 8888
